## ✨ Introduction
People from Montréal are concerned with snowplowing operations, but increasing the allowed funds
is still a delicate point for the city council [Lef19], and it is now an objective to reduce these operations cost,
while still providing an effecient snowplow service to the inhabitants. The city tasks your company with a study.
The goal is to minimize the cost of a typical snowplowing day. Our’s role is to find a short enough path
for the snowplows around the Montréal road network, while still remove snow from the whole given zone.
